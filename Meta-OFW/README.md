# Meta-OFW
 
This repository contains the code of **Meta-OFW** algorithm, in [Efficient Online Learning with Memory via Frank-Wolfe Optimization: Algorithms with Bounded Dynamic Regret and Applications to Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00497), by Hongyu Zhou, Zirui Xu, and Vasileios Tzoumas.

To run the experiments, run `main.py`.

### Acknowledgements
We thank Zhao et al. (the authors of [Non-stationary Online Learning with Memory and Non-stochastic Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03758)) for sharing with us the code of numerical evaluations of **Scream** algorithm. Our code is largely based on their experiment implementation.
