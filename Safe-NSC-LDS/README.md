# Safe Non-Stochastic Control of Linear Dynamical Systems
 
This repository contains the code of **Safe-OGD** algorithm for linear dynamical systems.

To run the experiments, run `main.py`.

### Acknowledgements
We thank Zhao et al. (the authors of [Non-stationary Online Learning with Memory and Non-stochastic Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03758)) for sharing with us the code of numerical evaluations of **Scream** algorithm. Our code is largely based on their experiment implementation.
